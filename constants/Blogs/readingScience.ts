  "title": "Why Should We Stop Reading Science and Start Doing It?",
  "summary": "The true spirit of science lies in discovery, a sentiment echoed by scripture and the career of Michael Faraday. This article argues that science should be experienced, not merely read. We explore Faraday’s philosophy of \"active investigation\", which rejects passive lectures in favour of hands-on experimentation. By positioning the student as a discoverer, we outline a three-stage journey: observing a phenomenon, manipulating variables to gather data, and using inductive reasoning to construct scientific concepts. This shift from receiving facts to doing science ensures that students build durable, transferable knowledge rooted in their own visual and tactile experience.\n",

      "text": "Michael Faraday’s (1791–1867) legacy is rooted in the conviction that science should be seen, touched, and felt, not just read about. The self taught pioneer of electromagnetism was a master of the live demonstration, embodying his teaching mantra: \"The lecturer should never talk down to the audience, but bring the subject up to them.\" At its heart, Faraday’s approach is a call for an active investigation pedagogy. It rejects the passive lecture and replaces it with direct, tangible experience. When students are given apparatus and allowed to manipulate variables, they are not just watching; they are building the scientific concept within themselves. This is the bedrock of hands on experiments, creating science experiences that spark genuine wonder through exploration.\n",

      "text": "Following Faraday’s philosophy, effective science teaching moves students through three stages of discovery to mastery. The teacher first presents a phenomenon (like magnetic induction) without explaining the rule. Students then use hands on experiments to explore the phenomenon, gathering visual and tactile data. They are guided toward inductive reasoning, moving from specific observations gathered in the lab to the general scientific idea or rule. The teacher facilitates a dialogue where students, using their empirical data, construct the generalized scientific concept themselves. The formal term or equation is introduced only after the concept is mastered. By structuring learning this way, we ensure the best learning happens when students discover the scientific truth for themselves, creating durable, transferable knowledge structures rooted in their own experience.\n",
